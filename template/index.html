             <h2>Welcome to the Healthcare Prediction System</h2>
            <p>
                This intelligent healthcare assistant uses Machine Learning models to predict the likelihood of 
                common diseases based on your health data. It currently supports prediction for 
                <strong>Diabetes</strong>, <strong>Heart Disease</strong>, and <strong>Parkinson's Disease</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early detection is key to prevention and treatment. This system helps patients and healthcare 
                professionals take proactive steps towards better health by providing accurate predictions, 
                visual insights, and educational information about each disease.

                    <p>
                        Diabetes is a chronic condition where the body cannot properly process sugar (glucose) 
                        due to insufficient insulin production or resistance. Left unchecked, it can damage 
                        vital organs and increase the risk of heart disease, kidney failure, and vision problems.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Common Symptoms:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Frequent urination and excessive thirst</li>
                        <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
                        <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
                        <li>Slow-healing wounds and frequent infections</li>
                        <li>Blurred vision</li>

                    <p>
                        Heart disease encompasses conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, including 
                        coronary artery disease, heart attacks, and arrhythmias. Early detection reduces the 
                        risk of severe complications and improves long-term health outcomes.

                    <p>
                        Parkinson‚Äôs Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and 
                        coordination. Symptoms often start subtly but worsen over time. Early detection allows 
                        timely interventions that can significantly improve quality of life.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Common Symptoms:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tremors in hands, fingers, or limbs</li>
                        <li>Muscle stiffness and slowed movement</li>
                        <li>Balance and coordination problems</li>
                        <li>Changes in speech or handwriting</li>

            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                This project is built using <strong>Flask</strong> for the web interface and <strong>Machine Learning</strong> 
                models for prediction. Each disease model is trained on real-world datasets and evaluated using 
                metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system is designed for educational purposes and as a tool for early awareness. It allows 
                users to enter simple health parameters and receive predictions, along with visual insights like 
                confusion matrices and feature importance charts.
            </p>
            <p>
                By combining machine intelligence with clear, understandable information about symptoms and effects, 
                this project encourages proactive healthcare and informed decisions.
